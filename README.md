# Data Wrangling
This project is part of Udacity data analyst nanodegree. I'm gathering 3 datasets from different sources and different file formats. 
Then assess and clean the dataset to prepare it for further analysis.

Project files:

wrangle_act: Code for gathering, assessing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.

wrangle_report: Briefly describe the effort taken in each step of the wrangling process.

act_report: Briefly communicates the insights and displays the visualization produced from the final data.
